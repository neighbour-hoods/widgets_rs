== overview

this is an experimental repo which uses Rust to build UIs for Holochain, and features a `wasm-bindgen` FFI binding library to the https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js[holochain-client-js] library.

== ðŸ›‘ note ðŸ›‘

this repo is abandoned, as of 2022-10-26, due to the team's decision to build initial versions of neighbourhoods applets and sensemaker-lite with Javascript frontends. 

== initial repo setup

=== init submodules

[source]
----
git submodule update --init
----

== Nix setup

install a https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Installing_flakes[Flakes] supporting https://nixos.org/download.html[`nix`]

edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf` to include the following:

----
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
----

optionally (but strongly suggested because it will dramatically speed up first-build times), also add these lines to `nix.conf` in order to enable the Holochain binary caches.
public keys can be checked at the substituter URLs.

== building

prequisite: follow 'Nix setup' above.

[source]
----
# enter dev shell (we need impure because Holonix is not pure ðŸ˜¢)
$ nix develop --impure
[<...>]$ npm install
[<...>]$ npm run hc:build
[<...>]$ npm run hc:pack
[<...>]$ npm run hc:mk-sensemaker # this may take a while to run
----

== running

# in dev shell
[<...>]$ npm run hc:run
